Fun, Fiction & Fallacies is where storytellers come to break the rules.

We’re an indie home for writers and artists who want to tell raw, creative, and boundary-pushing stories — from graphic novels, Web novels to original fiction.

Our goal is to give creators freedom, and give readers stories that make them think, laugh, and question everything they thought they knew.
